# Ergonomic-Menu-UI-Study
An application built to test the effectiveness of different menu layouts

##About
This application is designed for a human-computer interaction study. It presents the user with multiple menu layouts in hopes to better understand which layout is more efficient.  With the size of phones increasing, navigating menus with one hand can be a problematic task, especially while the user is in motion. This study focuses on a diagonal menu, which could be more ergonomically pleasing. 

##Usage

Install the Java Development Kit (JDK)

Install Eclipse (oh god)

Install the SDK Tools and the Android Eclipse Plugin

Start Eclipse and run the Android IDE

Import the project and click run
